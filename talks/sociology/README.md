# The Sociology of Programming Languages

## Confessions of a Language Salesman

- Change function (perceived adoption)
  - [need / pain] > 1
- Approrach by language designers should drive to zero.
- Think about groups of people.
  - Exploit social foundations

## Questions

- How does a programming language grow?
  - How does music spread?
    - Via friends.
  - Create language -> grow libraries and users -> share
- What triggers a niche language to be more widely used?
 - There's a really, really, really long tail of languages.

## Data

- Overtime people generally self report that they know ~4 languages well.
  - And ~5-6 slightly well
- There really isn't a noticable age difference between knowing a language.

## Diffusion of Innovation

- How are things adopted across people.
- There are catalysts which really spur surges in change
- How do we know things have improved without feedback?
