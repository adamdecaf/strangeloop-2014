# Visualizing Persistent Data Structures

## Types

- Persistent vs Ephemeral classes of data structures
  - Even a Fully Persistent class
    - At any point in history you can branch and continue with operations.
  - Confluently Persistent
    - Ability to merge a branch of history back into another branch of modifications

## Data Structure Cards

- Like baseball cards, why not encode data structure details on cards?
- Then it's easy to compare concrete and abstract structures

## Visual Representations

- Useful to trace values and their life cycles in data structures.
  - Two JS libraries. (One Facebook wrote)
