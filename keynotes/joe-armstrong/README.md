# The Mess We're In

> Joe Armstrong

## Over the years

- Why with the massive increase in computational speed hasn't everything else speed up.
- We have old cold now. Code that has just ran for years and years.

## Complexity

- A C program with 6 32-bit ints can have more states than the number of atoms in the universe.
- A 250GB SSD can have `2^250 (billion)` different states.
  - You'd need `2^7633587786` universes to hold the number of states of your SSD.
- Everything will fail, deal with it.

## Tools

- We have thousands of languages, and hundreds of tools that try and solve our problems.
- Why haven't the golden tools been created yet?

## Physics

- We actually break some basic laws everyday.
  - Relying on the same state on multiple machines?
  - How can we really have knowledge of replication without causality.
- Entropy always increases, same as with software.
- There are some limits we have in our universe.
  - Max clock rate of mass.
  - Minimum amount of energy required to change state.

## The ultimate laptop.

- It's a black hole. (Black Hole Computers -- Scientific American 2012)
- Performs `10^50` operations / sec
- Requires entangled particles
- Exists for `10^-21` seconds

## The "real" ultimate laptop

- What if we could condense the universe into a black hold?
  - Would make a pretty good computer
- The universe has done `10^123` operations since it's boot.

## Duplication

- Why do we allow duplicated files?
  - We should easily be able to make distributed filesystems in which files are hashed and referenced thus so.
  - Or at least let us help find the most similar file to a given file.
    - Least Comprssion Distance
      - `A approx B` if `size(C(A)) approx size(C(A ++ B))`

## Summary

- We've made a mess
- Need to reverse entropy (system complexity)
- We need maths
- Abolish naming (replace with hashes)
- Create global public hash tables
- Computers are becoming a big environmental threat
